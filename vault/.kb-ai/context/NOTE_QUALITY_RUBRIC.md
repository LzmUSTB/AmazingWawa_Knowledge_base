# Note Quality Rubric

Target score: 4 or higher.

## 5 Excellent

The note is at least as clear as the source and preferably clearer.

Criteria:

- precise definition,
- clear problem,
- mechanism,
- examples,
- parameters,
- mistakes,
- meaningful relations,
- review questions,
- purposeful original source visuals,
- all important interactive demos represented,
- source blocks close to source-grounded explanations,
- AI-authored JS interactions improve understanding when used.

## 4 Good

Usable and mostly complete. Clear mechanism and concrete examples. Important source assets are preserved or linked.

## 3 Shallow

Structurally valid but too summary-like, or missing some important source visuals/demos.

## 2 Poor

Mostly paraphrase with little mechanism. Tutorial source is heavily compressed.

A rich HTML note cannot score above 2 if it replaces high-quality original figures or interactive demos with AI-generated images.

## 1 Invalid

Incorrect, empty, misleading, broken, or fails source asset preservation.

## Mandatory self-check

For each note, answer in `review/validation-checklist.md`:

```yaml
note_quality:
  node_id:
  contentFormat: markdown | html | none
  estimated_score:
  strongest_part:
  weakest_part:
  source_assets_preserved: true | false
  required_demos_represented: true | false
  generated_images_used: false
  source_blocks_near_claims: true | false
  revision_done: true | false
```


# Source-first strict revisions

These rules override weaker or older guidance in this context export.

## Snapshot-backed source preservation

If a package includes `assets/source-snapshot/`, that snapshot must be treated as the highest-priority source asset library.

Do not use a whole snapshot iframe as the primary note representation. The AI should use the snapshot's local assets and behavior to implement the important demos directly inside `note.html` with knowledge-base-styled HTML/CSS/JS.

Allowed fallback: a whole-snapshot iframe may be included only as a secondary reference/debug view when the interaction cannot be isolated or faithfully reimplemented. It must be clearly labeled as fallback and must not replace the teaching explanation.

## Original media and interactive demos

For asset-rich or interactive sources, source-root links are not enough. A note must try to show or reconstruct original source material directly inside the note.

Priority order when no source snapshot exists:

1. Direct original media URL: `<img src="https://...">`, `<video src="https://...">`, `<source src="https://...">`.
2. Local copied original media: `<img src="assets/original/...">` or `<img src="assets/source-assets/...">`.
3. Original interactive source embed only if no snapshot is available and direct reconstruction is not feasible.
4. Direct source demo link with exact location label.
5. AI-authored JS/Canvas/SVG demos only as supplementary explanation.

Priority order when a source snapshot exists:

1. Use local original assets from `assets/source-snapshot/<source-id>/_resources/`.
2. Reimplement source interactions directly in the note using knowledge-base-styled controls and snapshot-observed behavior.
3. Use source URL/source blocks for attribution and source location.
4. Use iframe only as fallback/reference, not as the primary final note.

Forbidden as a complete preservation strategy:

```yaml
preservation_strategy: source-link + js-reproduction
```

Also forbidden when a snapshot exists:

```yaml
preservation_strategy: snapshot-iframe-only
```

## Required source asset markers

Every required source asset or demo must have a stable id and must be marked in the HTML with `data-source-asset`:

```html
<section class="rich-js-demo" data-source-asset="pinhole-diameter-distance-demo">
  <!-- Directly implemented controls/canvas/SVG using snapshot assets and observed behavior. -->
</section>
```

For snapshot-backed demos, prefer this manifest shape:

```yaml
source_assets:
  - id: pinhole-diameter-distance-demo
    type: interactive-demo
    source_url: https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/
    source_location: Pinhole camera / hole diameter and sensor distance sliders
    required: true
    represented_in_node: pinhole-camera-geometry
    note_location: section 01
    snapshot_path: assets/source-snapshot/cameras-and-lenses/index.html
    snapshot_assets_used:
      - assets/source-snapshot/cameras-and-lenses/_resources/example.png
    preservation_strategy: snapshot-assets + direct-js-reimplementation
```

Do not put `node-id / section xx` into `note_location` as the only machine-readable location. Use `represented_in_node` for the node id.

## UI adaptation rule

The note's explanatory UI may be redesigned to match the knowledge base style: hard-edged panels, dark theme, restrained accent color, clear control labels, and app font-size variables.

The source interaction's meaning must remain faithful: preserve variables, cause-effect behavior, and observed outcomes. Do not hide important original controls or simplify the interaction so much that the concept becomes weaker than the source.

## Locale rule

Use the target locale for explanations, section titles, captions, review questions, and answers.

Locale priority:

1. `manifest.yaml.language`,
2. `AI_CONTEXT.yaml.vault.language`,
3. source language,
4. `zh-CN` fallback.

Keep standard technical terms in English when they are more precise, but explain them in the target locale.

## Review questions with answers

Review questions must not be a bare list. Each question must include an answer using `details`/`summary`:

```html
<section class="rich-review">
  <h2>复习问题</h2>
  <details class="rich-qa">
    <summary>为什么小孔相机会形成倒立图像？</summary>
    <div class="rich-answer">
      <p>因为来自场景上方的光线穿过小孔后落到传感器下方，来自左侧的光线落到右侧，上下和左右各翻转一次，合起来相当于 180° 旋转。</p>
      <aside class="source-block">
        <strong>Source</strong>
        <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cameras and Lenses</a>
        <span>Location: Pinhole camera / ray inversion explanation</span>
      </aside>
    </div>
  </details>
</section>
```

Bare `<ol><li>question</li></ol>` review sections are not acceptable for final-quality notes.

## Quality bar for Ciechanowski-style sources

For sources whose clarity comes from interactive demos, the package must not pretend that a local AI-authored canvas is equivalent to the original. If a source snapshot exists, the correct high-fidelity approach is direct note implementation using snapshot assets and behavior, not repeated iframes or external links.
