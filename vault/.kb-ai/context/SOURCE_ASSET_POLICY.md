# Source Asset Policy

## Hard rule

Do not generate images. Use original source assets or source URLs.

This policy applies to:

- images,
- diagrams,
- screenshots,
- animations,
- videos,
- interactive demos,
- downloadable source/project files.

## Allowed preservation strategies

Use the strongest available strategy:

1. `direct-url`: reference original stable URL in HTML.
2. `local-copy`: include a local copy of the original source asset.
3. `iframe`: embed original interactive source/demo page.
4. `source-link`: provide exact link and section/demo locator.
5. `js-reproduction`: create an AI-authored interactive explanation with JS/SVG/Canvas only as a supplement.

## Source asset manifest

Every package based on a visual or interactive source must include:

```text
review/source-asset-manifest.md
```

Use this shape:

```yaml
source_assets:
  - id:
    type: image | video | animation | interactive-demo | downloadable-project | external-page
    source_url:
    source_location:
    required: true | false
    teaching_role:
    preservation_strategy: direct-url | local-copy | iframe | source-link | js-reproduction
    represented_in_note: true | false
    note_location:
```

## Required asset coverage

If `required: true`, the note must represent it. If it cannot be embedded, provide a source link and explain why.

A package is low quality if it omits required visuals or replaces them with AI-generated images.


# Source-first strict revisions

These rules override weaker or older guidance in this context export.

## Original media and interactive demos

For asset-rich or interactive sources, source-root links are not enough. A note must try to show original source material directly inside the note.

Priority order:

1. Direct original media URL: `<img src="https://...">`, `<video src="https://...">`, `<source src="https://...">`.
2. Original interactive source embed: `<iframe src="https://...">` with `data-source-asset="..."`.
3. If per-demo URLs are unavailable, embed the source page or closest section URL and identify the exact source location in a nearby source block.
4. AI-authored JS/Canvas/SVG demos may be added only as supplementary explanation. They do not replace original demos.
5. If embedding is impossible because the source blocks framing, uses inaccessible generated resources, or exposes no stable asset URL, document this in `review/source-asset-manifest.md` using `unavailable_reason:` and provide a precise source link.

Forbidden as a complete preservation strategy:

```yaml
preservation_strategy: source-link + js-reproduction
```

This is allowed only as a fallback when paired with `unavailable_reason:` and explicit source blocks.

## Required source asset markers

Every required source asset or demo must have a stable id and must be marked in the HTML with `data-source-asset`:

```html
<section class="rich-source-demo" data-source-asset="pinhole-diameter-distance-demo">
  <iframe class="rich-source-frame" src="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/#pinhole-camera"></iframe>
  <aside class="source-block">
    <strong>Source</strong>
    <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cameras and Lenses</a>
    <span>Location: Pinhole camera / hole diameter and sensor distance sliders</span>
  </aside>
</section>
```

In `review/source-asset-manifest.md`, use machine-readable note ids separately from human section labels:

```yaml
source_assets:
  - id: pinhole-diameter-distance-demo
    type: interactive-demo
    source_url: https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/
    source_location: Pinhole camera / hole diameter and sensor distance sliders
    required: true
    represented_in_node: pinhole-camera-geometry
    note_location: section 01
    preservation_strategy: iframe + supplementary-js
```

Do not put `node-id / section xx` into `note_location` as the only machine-readable location. Use `represented_in_node` for the node id.

## Review questions with answers

Review questions must not be a bare list. Each question must include an answer using `details`/`summary`:

```html
<section class="rich-review">
  <h2>复习问题</h2>
  <details class="rich-qa">
    <summary>为什么小孔相机会形成倒立图像？</summary>
    <div class="rich-answer">
      <p>因为来自场景上方的光线穿过小孔后落到传感器下方，来自左侧的光线落到右侧，上下和左右各翻转一次，合起来相当于 180° 旋转。</p>
      <aside class="source-block">
        <strong>Source</strong>
        <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cameras and Lenses</a>
        <span>Location: Pinhole camera / ray inversion explanation</span>
      </aside>
    </div>
  </details>
</section>
```

Bare `<ol><li>question</li></ol>` review sections are not acceptable for final-quality notes.

## Quality bar for Ciechanowski-style sources

For sources whose clarity comes from interactive demos, the package must not pretend that a local AI-authored canvas is equivalent to the original. The note should either embed the original source/demo, use original media URLs, or clearly state why a direct embed is impossible while still linking the exact source location.
